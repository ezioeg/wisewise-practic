# Wise Wise Practic
Wise Wise Practic is a technical test for React Native with Expo, where you are required to develop a single screen with a medical information card and related icons. The application must consume an API, fetch data, and display it in a dropdown. The evaluation focuses on React Native usage, API integration, and code optimization, all within a 2-hour time limit.
